SL(1): Cure your bad habit of mistyping
=======================================

SL (Steam Locomotive) runs across your terminal when you type "sl" as
you meant to type "ls". It's just a joke command, and not useful at
all.

# Update notes from eyJhb
I have merged the following 

- [Add SIGIN configuration and disco mode](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl/pull/55)
- [Add option for the number of cars](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl/pull/56)

I have also added `-v` and updated the last updated and version number to 5.04.
